# What is this?

This is a fun little UI library I have created, I have no UI qualifications or experience so feedback is welcome. This library is 100% focussed around Razor/Blazor with no support for other languages or frameworks.

# Why?

There are already a number of other UI libraries out there, so why add another one? All of the current UI libraries I have come across have been very complex or provide very little in the way of just easily applying my own color scheme. This library aims to solve that by having a simple top level configuration with all the theming needed.

# How to get started

Yeah look, at this point there isn't a nice way because I am still developing this, I will need to come back and modify this accordinngly when I have a single NuGet install ready

# Other Stuff
